      <h3>What is Reneawable Energy?</h3>
      <p>
        Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are
        replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind,
        for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished.
        Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us. Fossil fuels -
        coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are non-renewable resources that
        take hundreds of millions of years to form. Fossil fuels, when burned to
        produce energy, cause harmful greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon
        dioxide. Generating renewable energy creates far lower emissions than
        burning fossil fuels. Transitioning from fossil fuels, which currently
        account for the lion’s share of emissions, to renewable energy is key to
        addressing the climate crisis. Renewables are now cheaper in most
        countries, and generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels.

      <h3>Solar Energy</h3>
      <p>
        Solar energy is a powerful source of energy that can be used to heat,
        cool, and light homes and businesses.More energy from the sun falls on
        the earth in one hour than is used by everyone in the world in one year.
        A variety of technologies convert sunlight to usable energy for
        buildings. The most commonly used solar technologies for homes and
        businesses are solar photovoltaics for electricity, passive solar design
        for space heating and cooling, and solar water heating.usinesses and
        industry use solar technologies to diversify their energy sources,
        improve efficiency, and save money. Energy developers and utilities use
        solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power technologies to produce
        electricity on a massive scale to power cities and small towns.

      <h3>Wind Energy</h3>
      <p>
        Wind is caused when the earth's surface is heated unevenly by the sun.
        Wind energy can be used to generate electricity.Wind turbines, like
        windmills, are mounted on a tower to capture the most energy. At 100
        feet (30 meters) or more above ground, they can take advantage of the
        faster and less turbulent wind. Turbines catch the wind's energy with
        their propeller-like blades. Usually, two or three blades are mounted on
        a shaft to form a rotor. A blade acts much like an airplane wing. When
        the wind blows, a pocket of low-pressure air forms on the downwind side
        of the blade. The low-pressure air pocket then pulls the blade toward
        it, causing the rotor to turn. This is called lift. The force of the
        lift is actually much stronger than the wind's force against the front
        side of the blade, which is called drag. The combination of lift and
        drag causes the rotor to spin like a propeller, and the turning shaft
        spins a generator to make electricity.

      <h3>Hydro Energy</h3>
      <p>
        Hydropower—energy created from fresh, moving water—is the world's oldest
        form of renewable energy.Humans have used water power for centuries. But
        we didn't start making hydropower—electricity from our rivers, streams,
        and lakes—until just over 100 years ago, not too long after Thomas
        Edison invented electric power. Today, instead of using large, wooden
        wheels, we use propeller-like devices called turbines, which spin as
        water rushes through them, generating electricity. But hydropower has a
        secret power: It can also store huge amounts of renewable energy to use
        when other sources dry up.

      <h3>Geothermal Energy</h3>
      <p>
        Geothermal energy is the heat from the earth. This heat is used for
        bathing, to heat buildings, and to generate electricity.The word
        geothermal comes from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat), and
        geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because heat is
        continuously produced inside the earth. Many technologies have been
        developed to take advantage of geothermal energy: Hot water or steam
        reservoirs deep in the earth that are accessed by drilling. Geothermal
        reservoirs located near the earth's surface, mostly located in the
        western U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii. The shallow ground near the Earth's
        surface that maintains a relatively constant temperature of 50-60°F.
        This variety of geothermal resources allows them to be used on both
        large and small scales. A utility can use the hot water and steam from
        reservoirs to drive generators and produce electricity for its
        customers. Other applications apply the heat produced from geothermal
        directly to various uses in buildings, roads, agriculture, and
        industrial plants. Still others use the heat directly from the ground to
        provide heating and cooling in homes and other buildings.
